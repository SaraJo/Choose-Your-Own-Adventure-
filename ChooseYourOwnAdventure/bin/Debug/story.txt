4~1~ Are you sure?  Something doesn't seem quite right in the house... ~ Go Back ~ Bail ~ 6 ~ 5
5~9~ You go home, and go to bed.  You wake up the next morning to find police outside the sorority house.  "Yea, there was a carbon monoxide leak last night", the cop tells you, as paramedics roll out bag after bag...
6~1~ You go out into the hallway. There are two rooms. ~ Room on your left ~ Room on your right ~ 7 ~ 8
7~2~ You enter the room on the left.  You see a gerbil asleep in its cage.  But you didn't think gerbils slept on their wheel... odd.  You find a crowbar. ~ 9
8~2~ You enter the room on the right. This is a closet.  You come out of the closet. ~ 7

13~2~ You take your chainsaw and violently decimate the door to the locked room. ~ 15
14~2~ You gingerly take the crowbar and ax and pry open the locked door. ~ 15
15~4~ The girls are inside, they were having a meeting and the door locked from the outside.  They've been in there for hours and were beginning to get sleepy.  It turns out the gas fireplace in their meeting room was leaking.  You saved their lives.  They are very appreciative.  Your name is in the paper.  (Fastest acquition of STDs recorded locally.)
16~2~ You are too weak to open this door with just your crowbar. ~ 10
